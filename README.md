# Flink Diagrams

This is a personal collection of diagrams visualizing certain processes and relationships between components in Flink. The diagram can be found in [./plantuml/](https://github.com/XComp/flink-diagrams/tree/main/plantuml). Each change will to a PlantUML file will trigger the SVG generation through [Github Actions](https://github.com/XComp/flink-diagrams/actions/workflows/plantuml.yaml) which leads to the update of the corresponding SVG file in the [./diagrams/](https://github.com/XComp/flink-diagrams/tree/main/diagrams) subfolder.

These diagrams are not necessarily up-to-date. You might want to verify with the code to be sure about the current state of development in Flink!
